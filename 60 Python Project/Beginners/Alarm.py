Alarm Clock with Python

Before writing the program you should know that you also need an alarm tone which will ring at the time of 
the alarm. So you can download an alarm tune from here. Now as we are ready with the libraries and the alarm
song, letâ€™s see how to write a program to create an alarm clock with Python:

''' 

from datetime import datetime   
from playsound import playsound
alarm_time = input("Enter the time of alarm to be set:HH:MM:SS\n")
alarm_hour=alarm_time[0:2]
alarm_minute=alarm_time[3:5]
alarm_seconds=alarm_time[6:8]
alarm_period = alarm_time[9:11].upper()
print("Setting up alarm..")
while True:
    now = datetime.now()
    current_hour = now.strftime("%I")
    current_minute = now.strftime("%M")
    current_seconds = now.strftime("%S")
    current_period = now.strftime("%p")
    if(alarm_period==current_period):
        if(alarm_hour==current_hour):
            if(alarm_minute==current_minute):
                if(alarm_seconds==current_seconds):
                    print("Wake Up!")
                    playsound('audio.mp3')
                    break

'''
The user input should be in a format of hours: minutes: and then seconds. You will start listening to the
song as you will reach the time that has been set. To test your code set the time 2 or 3 minutes later 
from the time you are giving the user input. 

Summary
This idea can be implemented in software applications also, so you now have an idea of what can be a good 
Python project other than just designing the User interface of an application.
