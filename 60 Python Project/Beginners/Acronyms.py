Create Acronyms using Python

To create acronyms using Python, you need to write a python program that generates a short form of a 
word from a given sentence. You can do this by splitting and indexing to get the first word and then 
combine it. Let’s see how to create an acronym using Python:
'''


user_input = str(input("Enter a Phrase: "))
text = user_input.split()
a = " "
for i in text:
    a = a+str(i[0]).upper()
print(a)

'''
In the above code, I am first taking a string user input, then I am using the split() function in Python
 for splitting the sentence. Then I declared a new variable ‘a’ to store the acronym of a phrase.

Then at the end, I am running a for loop over the variable ‘text’ which represents the split of user input.
While running the for loop we are storing the index value of str[0] of every word after a split and turning
 it into an uppercase format by using the upper() function.

Summary

This is a great python program to test your logical skills. These types of programs contribute a lot to your 
coding interviews. So you should keep trying such programs to develop a good understanding of creating 
algorithms to perform well in your coding interviews.
