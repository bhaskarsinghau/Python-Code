Python Program to Generate Password

To write a Python program to create a password, declare a string of numbers + uppercase + lowercase 
+ special characters. Take a random sample of the string of a length given by the user:

'''
import random
passlen = int(input("Enter the length of password:"))
s="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@#$%^&*()?"
p = "".join(random.sample(s,passlen ))
print(p)

'''
In the above code, I first imported the random module in Python, then I asked for user input for the length 
of the password. Then I stored the letters, numbers and special characters that I want to be considered while
 generating a password. Then I am doing a random sampling by joining the length of the password and the 
 variable s, which will finally generate a random password.

Summary
There are a few areas where the above code could be improved upon, but at a basic level, it meets many secure 
password generation requirements by todayâ€™s standards. As a newbie to Python or any other language, you should
keep trying these types of programs as they help you explore more functions and in the long run will help you 
design your algorithms.
