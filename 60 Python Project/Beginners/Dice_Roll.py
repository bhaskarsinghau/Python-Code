Dice Roll Simulator with Python

To simulate a dice roll with Python, I’ll be using the random module in Python. The random module can be
imported easily into your code as it is preinstalled in the Python programming language. 

After importing the random module, you have access to all the functions included in the module. It’s a pretty
long list, but for our purposes, we’ll use the random.randint() function. This function returns a random 
integer based on the start and end we specify.

The smallest value of a dice roll is 1 and the largest is 6, this logic can be used to simulate a dice roll.
This gives us the start and end values to use in our random.randint() function. Now let’s see how to simulate
a dice roll with Python:

'''

#importing module for random number generation
import random

#range of the values of a dice
min_val = 1
max_val = 6

#to loop the rolling through user input
roll_again = "yes"

#loop
while roll_again == "yes" or roll_again == "y":
    print("Rolling The Dices...")
    print("The Values are :")
    
    #generating and printing 1st random integer from 1 to 6
    print(random.randint(min_val, max_val))
    
    #generating and printing 2nd random integer from 1 to 6
    print(random.randint(min_val, max_val))
    
    #asking user to roll the dice again. Any input other than yes or y will terminate the loop
    roll_again = input("Roll the Dices Again?")

This is a good task for someone beginner in Python to start with. These type of programs helps you to think 
logically and in the long run, it can also help you to create algorithms.
