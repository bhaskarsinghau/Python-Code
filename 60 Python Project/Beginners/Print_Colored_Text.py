What is Colorama in Python?
Using the Colorama module we can print colored text with Python. We can use it and call its built-in variables
which are aliases for the desired ANSI codes. This makes our code more readable and works better with Windows
command prompts after calling colorama.init() at the start of your script.

The Colorama module offers three main formatting options: Fore, Back, and Style. These allow us to change the
foreground or background text color and style. The colors available for the foreground and background are
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.

Print Colored Text with Python
Traditionally, printing full-colour text to the terminal is accomplished by a series of escape characters on 
Linux or OS X systems. However, this will not work for Windows operating systems. Now letâ€™s see how to print coloured text with Python using the Colorama module:
'''
import colorama
from colorama import Fore, Back, Style
colorama.init(autoreset=True)

print(Fore.BLUE+Back.YELLOW+"Hi My name is Bhaskar Singh "+ Fore.YELLOW+ Back.BLUE+"I am your Machine Learning Instructor")
print(Back.CYAN+"Hi My name is Aman Kharwal")
print(Fore.RED + Back.GREEN+ "Hi My name is Aman Kharwal")
