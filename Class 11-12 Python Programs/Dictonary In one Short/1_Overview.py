'''
A python dictionary is a collection of elements where each element is a combination of Key-Value pair.
Each value/values is associated with a unique key. All the Key-Value pairs are enclosed in Curly braces.
In other words we can say that ” Dictionaries are mutable, unordered collection of elements in the form
of Key-Value Pairs which are enclosed in curly braces“.

'''

a = {1 : 'One', 2 : 'Two', 3 : 'Three'}
b = {'A' : 'Apple', 'B' : 'Ball', 'C' : 'Cat'}
print(a)

'''Dictionary A has numeric Keys (1, 2, 3)and Values(“One”, “Two”, “Three” ) are in String, while dictionary
 B has both Keys(‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’) and Values(“Apple”, “Ball”, “Cat”) are in string.'''

# Characteristics of Python Dictionary:
'''
The combination of Key and Value is called Key-Value Pair.
Keys and it’s values are separated by colon(:)
Different Key-Value pairs are separated by comma(,).
Keys are unique for each Value.
Keys of dictionary must be of immutable type like string, number etc. '''
